# Token System

A simple token system with the ability to mint and burn your own tokens is implemented by this Solidity code.

## Description

A token's name, abbreviation, and total supply can all be defined with this contract. To expand the total amount and allocate them to addresses, you can mint additional tokens. Burning current tokens lowers their total supply and removes them from an address's balance, according to the contract.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* First To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
* Then Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste myTok.sol into the file.
* To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myTok.sol" button.
* Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the myTok contract from the dropdown menu, then click the "Deploy" button.
* Now at the left bottom side of the page, there is a section called "Deployed Contracts". below that, as you can see contract is deployed and by clicking into TOKENSYSTEM there are functions like burnToken, mintToken which will burn and mint coin respectively after that balances button will give a balance of the address that you put into the text field on the right side of the button. further, 3 more buttons will provide the token name, its abbreviation and total supply.
