# Token System

A simple token system with the ability to mint and burn your own tokens is implemented by this Solidity code.

## Description

A token's name, abbreviation, and total supply can all be defined with this contract. To expand the total amount and allocate them to addresses, you can mint additional tokens. Burning current tokens lowers their total supply and removes them from an address's balance, according to the contract.
